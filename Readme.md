# Terminal Habit Tracker

- This is a simple project to get started with using Rust


## Features:
- List of Habits
- When you click on a habit, it takes you to a new page
- There is a calendar on the habit that lets you mark whether you did it or not
- Depending on the habit there could be additional fields that you could track. (that will be an option to the user while adding a new habit)
- There is a bar chart with weeks, months and years of that habit existing. 
- A SQLite database will be used to save all of this stuff
